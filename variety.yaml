summary: Variety is an open-source wallpaper changer for Linux
description: |
  Variety is packed with great features, yet slim and easy to use. 
  It can use local images or automatically download wallpapers from Unsplash and other online sources, allows you to rotate them on a regular interval, and provides easy ways to separate the great images from the junk. 
  Variety can also display wise and funny quotations or a nice digital clock on the desktop.
